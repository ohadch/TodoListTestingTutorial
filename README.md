# TodoList Testing Tutorial

This is a simple project that is intended to be a platform that helps me teach how to properly test your code.

I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, so in order to prevent usage of external services (e.g DB) I developed a small JSON database that is used here.

## Stack:

- **Server**: node/js/express
- **Client**: react
- **DB**: In house JSON database
- **Unit/integration tests**: mocha + chai + sinon + supertest
- **E2E tests**: cypress
